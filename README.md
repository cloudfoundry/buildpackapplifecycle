# BBS

Bulletin Board System (BBS) is the API to access the database for Diego.
It communicates via protocol-buffer-encoded RPC-style calls over HTTP.

Diego clients communicate with the BBS via an
[ExternalClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry/bbs#ExternalClient)
interface. This interface allows clients to create, read, update,
delete, and subscribe to events about Tasks and LRPs.
